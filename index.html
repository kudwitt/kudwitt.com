    <p><a href="https://www.gfigroup.com/">GFI Group</a> is a Wall Street Interdealer Broker and we sold our new issue bond auction trading platform to them. Auctions.com was a well funded startup that tried but failed to compete with eBay and our technology was stellar. Patron Technology (now <a href="https://leapevent.tech/">Leap</a>) is the system of record for many arts and cultural organizations and was sold to <a href="https://www.provequity.com/">Providence Equity</a>.</p>
